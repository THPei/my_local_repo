                             The calculations of the multislice method in Proteins

  Electron microscopy has been developed more than thirty years. It includes two basic types of transmission electron microscrope. One is 
the conventional fixed-beam microscope (CTEM), and the other is the scanning microscope (STEM). Tranditionally, the electron energy is 
often as high as 100~200 KeV resulting in both of them high resolution microscope. However, the resolution, for some proteins whose weights
are less than 80K Doltons, decreases dramatically. It causes our curiosity to know the reason and figure out the resolution limitation 
through the calculations of the multislice method.
