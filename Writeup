  Electron microscopy has been developed more than thirty years. It includes two basic types of transmission electron microscrope. One is 
  the conventional fixed-beam microscope (CTEM), and the other is the scanning microscope (STEM). Tranditionally, the electron energy is 
  often as high as 100~200 KeV resulting in both of them high resolution microscope.
